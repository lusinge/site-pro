Dear Sir or Madam,

As a second-year student at the École des Mines de Saint-Étienne, specializing in microelectronics and computer science, I am actively seeking an internship that will serve not only as a professional stepping stone but also as an opportunity to make a meaningful contribution in an innovative environment.

My academic journey has equipped me with solid skills in electronics and computer science, further enriched by a keen interest in the practical application of these disciplines. This interest extends beyond theoretical aspects and is driven by a genuine passion for technology and its real-world impacts.

I am particularly motivated by the prospect of working on projects involving artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, or embedded systems. I hold great admiration for companies that innovate in these fields, and I am confident that my skills and enthusiasm would be valuable assets.

I am available for a 17-week internship, ideally between April and July 2024. I am convinced that this experience would be mutually beneficial, offering a rich learning opportunity for me and a valuable contribution to the team I would join. I currently live in Aix-en-Provence, but I am willing to relocate.

Thank you in advance for considering my application. I am readily available for any further information or for an interview at your convenience.

Yours faithfully,

Lucien GHEERBRANT
